        <h2>The Authenticity Crisis Is Costing You More Than Revenue</h2>
        <div class="pain-points">
            <div class="pain-point">
                <h3>Counterfeits Erode Brand Equity Faster Than Product Defects</h3>
                <p>Every fake product in circulation is a brand violation you can't control. Consumers can't distinguish authentic from counterfeit at point-of-purchase. Traditional anti-counterfeit measures are easily replicated. Your brand needs proof-of-origin that travels with the product.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pain-point">
                <h3>Supply Chain Opacity Makes Compliance a Liability</h3>
                <p>Regulators demand traceability. Consumers demand transparency. Yet your supply chain operates in silos. AuthiChain creates an immutable audit trail from factory floor to final sale, anchored on-chain and queryable in seconds.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="pain-point">
                <h3>Your Anti-Counterfeit Budget Has No ROI Visibility</h3>
                <p>You're spending on monitoring, but have no real-time intel on where counterfeits originate. AuthiChain doesn't just authenticate; it generates actionable intelligence. Every scan and truth claim feeds a predictive risk model.</p>

                <h3>Proof-of-Origin at Manufacturing</h3>
                <p>Every product gets a unique QRON code — a living QR identity that's blockchain-anchored. This record links to SKU, batch, timestamp, and certifications. It cannot be forged or tampered with.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">2</span>
                <h3>Distributed Truth Claims</h3>
                <p>Consumers scan QRON codes and submit truth claims — authenticity verdicts backed by photos. AuthiChain aggregates claims using reputation-weighted consensus. serial accuracy builders become trusted validators.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <span class="step-number">3</span>
                <h3>Historical Incident Intelligence</h3>
                <p>AuthiChain ingests historical data — customs seizures, recalls, marketplace flags — and links them to SKU-level risk profiles. Geographic heatmaps show where counterfeits cluster.</p>
