# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Updated the Analytics component to use the official Vercel Web Analytics component for Next.js App Router, replacing the previous `inject()` method with the recommended `<Analytics />` component approach.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files
- **components/Analytics.tsx**
  - Replaced `inject()` function from `@vercel/analytics` with the `<Analytics />` component from `@vercel/analytics/next`
  - Removed `'use client'` directive (no longer needed as the Vercel Analytics component handles this internally)
  - Updated the component to return the JSX element instead of calling inject and returning null
  - Updated documentation comments to reflect the new implementation

## Implementation Details

The project already had:
- `@vercel/analytics` package installed (version 1.6.1)
- An Analytics component wrapper in `components/Analytics.tsx`
- The Analytics component properly placed in `app/layout.tsx` inside the `<body>` tag after the `{children}` component

### What Changed
**Before:**
```tsx
'use client';
import { inject } from '@vercel/analytics';

export function Analytics() {
  inject();
  return null;
}
```

**After:**
```tsx
import { Analytics as VercelAnalytics } from '@vercel/analytics/next';

export function Analytics() {
  return <VercelAnalytics />;
}
```

## Benefits of This Approach
1. **Recommended Pattern**: Uses the official Next.js-specific Analytics component from `@vercel/analytics/next` which is the current best practice
2. **Better Integration**: The component approach provides better integration with Next.js App Router features
3. **Cleaner Code**: More declarative and follows React component patterns
4. **Automatic Client Rendering**: The Vercel Analytics component handles client-side rendering internally

## Verification
- ✅ ESLint passed with no errors
- ✅ No new dependencies required (package already installed)
- ✅ Component properly integrated in the root layout
- ✅ Follows Next.js App Router conventions

## Notes
- The Analytics component is correctly positioned in `app/layout.tsx` after the `<Providers>` wrapper and before the closing `</body>` tag
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- The wrapper pattern (re-exporting as `Analytics`) maintains clean imports throughout the codebase
